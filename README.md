# Gestures

Gestures is a Python-based project that enables you to control the mouse pointer on your computer using hand gestures. It utilizes the MediaPipe library for hand tracking and the OpenCV library for camera access and frame extraction.

## Demo

The demo video is not out yet; I'm working on it. Stay tuned!

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. The required libraries will be installed automatically when you run the main script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Matthiasklaasse/gestures.git
cd gestures
python gestures.py
```
##Configuration
You can customize certain parameters in the config.ini file to adjust sensitivity, click duration, or any other settings that suit your preferences.

##Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues or have questions, please let me know (in the YouTube comments of the demo video).
